# Machine-Learning
This repo contains most of the common algorithms you'd find in Machine Learning.
It provides notes, examples, and datasets to use for anyone looking to learn about ML.
I recommend researching all of the mathematics that go into these algorithms, since it's very heavy on Linear Algebra and Calculus, if you want understand them completely. 
Feel free to download this repo and play around with the algorithms and explore the ideas involved.
